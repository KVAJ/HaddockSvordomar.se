## Haddock Swear

Captain Haddock from Tin Tin can swear. In fact, he's the best at it.

Here's the source code for it!

## Project information


### Origins

First seen in a facebook comment within the greatest Swedish developer group,
[Kodapor](https://www.facebook.com/groups/utvecklare.stockholm/), a sparkling 
idea begun to raise. 


Who wouldn't like the possibility to surf into a webpage which rotates between
all of those lovely swears of Captain Haddock from Tin Tin?


And maybe create a community around it, with additional sites around same 
concept, all held within in the same code repository..

### Setup on a local environment

> See [The Setup Guide](SETUP.md)


### Contribution

Want to add missing swears? Or maybe a site with the same concept, but for
another character? You are more than welcome to do so!


Just make sure to read the [Contribution Guidelines](CONTRIBUTIONS.md) first.
